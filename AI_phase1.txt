Earthquake Prediction Model using Python 

Problem Definition and Design ;Thinking;The problem is to develop an earthquake prediction model using a Kaggle dataset. The objective is to explore and understand the key features of earthquake data, visualize the data on a world map for a global overview, split the data for training and testing, and build a neural network model to predict earthquake magnitudes based on the given features.
Design Thinking:
1.Data Source: Choose a suitable Kaggle dataset containing earthquake data with features like date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude.
2.Feature Exploration: Analyze and understand the distribution, correlations, and characteristics of the key features.
3.Visualization: Create a world map visualization to display earthquake frequency distribution.
4.Data Splitting: Split the dataset into a training set and a test set for model validation.
5.Model Development: Build a neural network model for earthquake magnitude prediction.
6.Training and Evaluation: Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set
Phase 2: Innovation
Consider advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to improve the prediction model's performance.
Phase 3: Development Part 1
Begin building the earthquake prediction model by loading and preprocessing the dataset.

Phase 4: Development Part 2
Continue building the earthquake prediction model by visualizing the data on a world map and splitting it into training and testing sets.
